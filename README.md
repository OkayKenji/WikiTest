# 1.  Introduction  

The following subsections of the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) document should provide an overview of the entire SRS.   The thing to keep in mind as you write this document is that you are telling what the system must do – so that designers can ultimately build it.  Do not use this document for design!!!

## 1.1  Purpose  

Identify the purpose of this SRS and its intended audience. In this subsection, describe the purpose of the particular SRS and specify the intended audience for the SRS.

## 1.2  Scope 

In this subsection:
(1)	 Identify the software product(s) to be produced by name
(2)	 Explain what the software product(s) will, and, if necessary, will not do
(3)	 Describe the application of the software being specified, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals  
(4)	 Be consistent with similar statements in higher-level specifications if they exist

This should be an executive-level summary.  Do not enumerate the whole requirements list here.

## 1.3  Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations.  

Provide the definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations required to properly interpret the SRS.  This information may be provided by reference to one or more appendices in the SRS or by reference to documents. This information may be provided by reference to an Appendix.

## 1.4  References  

In this subsection:
(1)  Provide a complete list of all documents referenced elsewhere in the SRS
(2)  Identify each document by title, report number (if applicable), date, and publishing organization
(3)	Specify the sources from which the references can be obtained.

This information can be provided by reference to an appendix or to another document.  If your application uses specific protocols or RFC’s, then reference them here so designers know where to find them. 

## 1.5  Overview  

In this subsection:
(1)	Describe what the rest of the SRS contains
(2)	Explain how the SRS is organized

Don’t rehash the table of contents here.  Point people to the parts of the document they are most concerned with.  Customers/potential users care about section 2, developers care about section 3.
